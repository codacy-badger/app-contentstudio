=== Improvements in HTML Editor

* *Paste mode*

New toggle button image:html-area-paste-mode-button.png[,24,24] in the HTML Editor toolbar allows toggling between "formatted text" (default setting) and "plain text"
modes when pasting text into the editor.

* *Fullscreen mode*

Improved look and feel of the Fullscreen mode makes editing a pleasant experience, especially on small screen devices.

* *Changes in the "Table Properties" modal dialog*

** New "_Caption_" property in the "*Table Properties*" modal dialog allows adding caption for a table.
** _Border_, _Cell spacing_ and _Cell padding_ properties have been removed. These properties should be set via stylesheets.

* *Misc changes*

** Cursor position is kept when switching to the "_Fullscreen_" mode

** Cursor position is set to clicked position after user clicks inside HTML Area input to start editing

** Toolbar buttons for *B* (Bold), *I* (Italic) and *U* (underline) are removed inside HTML Area input type to give room for the
new paste mode button. <<keyboard-shortcuts#rich_text_editor,Keyboard shortcuts>> should be used to apply this styling. They are still present in Fullscreen mode and inside Text component editor.

=== Improved content deletion

*"Delete content"* dialog has been improved to give better user experience when deleting published content. **Delete** button is turned into menu button
with *"Delete Now"* as default action which will instantly delete published content. To mark selected content as deleted instead of instant deletion,
expand the dropdown and select *"Mark as deleted"* from the menu. Offline content will always be deleted instantly, as before.

=== Content Workflow

*Content Workflow* is a process that helps web editor to get content through its entire lifecycle, from the moment of creation all the way
to publishing. Checks on different workflow stages ensure that content doesn't get published while it's invalid or before it's finished,
and that it can be verified and published by a different user with sufficient permissions.

Read more about Content Workflow <<workflow#,here>>.

=== Publish Requests

*Publish Request* is a stage of the Content Workflow when web editor has finished work on the content and requests its publishing from a different
user(s) with sufficient Publishing permissions. Each request describes the changes to be published, which items will be published, and
optional publishing schedule.

Read more about Publish Requests <<workflow#publish_request,here>>.

=== Customizable placeholder for the Display Name field

When a new content item is created, default placeholder text for the Display Name field is "_<Display Name>_".
From version 2.1.0 this text can be customised with new `display-name-label` field in the content type schema:

Customize display name field placeholder
[source,XML]
----
<content-type>
  <display-name>My Content Type</display-name>
  <display-name-label i18n="displayName.placeholder">Some cool text here</display-name-label>
</content-type>
----

== 2.0.0

Until the release of Enonic XP 7 the Content Studio app used to be a part of the XP distribution package.
*Content Studio 2.0* is the first version released on Enonic Market separately from XP.
It is compatible with XP 7.0 and will not work with earlier versions. This release includes some important features, as well as
a number of major improvements and bugfixes.


=== Context panel

In previous versions *Context panel* (previously "Detail panel") was available only in the Browse Content view. Starting from version 2.0,
the panel is available in the Content Edit view as well. User can now access widgets without having to switch to or open the Browse view.
The panel can be opened and closed by clicking the cog icon in the top right corner of the view.

Compared to the Context panel available in the Browse Content view, in this view the panel adds the widget for managing selected content, such
as adding new components to the page or configuring existing page components.

You can find more information about the Context Panel and widgets in the <<widgets#,dedicated section>>.


=== Icons in the Content Wizard form navigator

Schedule, Settings and Access steps of the Content Wizard form are now represented with icons in the navigator toolbar, to separate
them from the custom steps of the form.
Clicking the icon would scroll the form down to selected step.

image::wizard-form-navigator.png[]

Unlocked lock icon for the Access step means that this content is accessible by everyone (user Everyone has at least "Can Read" permissions).
Locked lock icon means that read access is limited.

=== Attachment preview

Content Studio 2.0 enables automatic preview of the media content (video, audio, PDF, DOCX etc.) directly in the preview panel.

=== Improved table features in the Rich text editor

Table features in the Rich text editor have been greatly improved and now enable changing column width, cell spacing/padding and border width
via "Table Properties" modal dialog (right-click the table and select "Table properties" from the context menu).

image::html-area-table2.png[]

The same context menu can be used to add and delete rows and columns, merge several cells into one etc.

=== Relative image width in the Rich text editor

Image dialog of the Rich text editor now allows user to adjust relative width of the image.
Check off "Custom width" checkbox in the modal dialog and adjust the width using the drag control.

image::image-dialog-custom-width.png[]

=== Image styles

Content Studio 2.0 introduces a new feature in the rich text editor called "Image styles".
Image styles consist of both client side styling (css), and image service rendering specifications.

The rich text editor was previously limited to pre-defined and hard-coded styles, such as `cinema (21:9)` or `square(1:1)`.
Now, application developers may define custom styles that control both server side rendering aspect ratio, and specify classes to annotate the specific image.

Read more about defining custom image styles in the <<editor/rich-text-editor#custom_image_styles,dedicated section>>.

=== New "inline" mode for content preview inside Content Studio

XP 7.0 introduced a new value for portal rendering mode (`mode` field in the HTTP request object).
In addition to _edit_ (when content is being edited in the Page Editor), _preview_ (preview of a draft version)
and _live_ (preview of a master version), when content is rendered in the preview panel of the Content Studio the `request.mode` will
have a value of *_inline_*.


=== Limiting Tag input to specific path

Previously, Tag input always allowed tags from all available content in the repo.
Now tags are by default limited to current site.
You can use `allowPath` config to adjust this limit and allow content outside of the current site.

Allow tags from other sites
[source,XML]

<input name="MyTag" type="Tag">
  <label>Tags for this content</label>
  <occurrences minimum="0" maximum="0"/>

  </config>
</input>

XML schemas of content types, pages and page component descriptors now support optional `description` field which, if filled,
will be shown in the Content Studio UI.
